# grouping_clustering_project


Assignment: “Your task is to develop a proposal for how we can add value by automatically grouping user searches/watches into “trips,” and to quantify the potential impact of your approach. 
My Interpretation: group searches in a way that can enable business value. 
My Solution: A data product - a pipeline that assigns a grouping to each search / watch. The grouping is based on tiers that features (ex: price) of this search / watch fall under (ex: high vs low price). Discretization and K-Means algorithms are used to do the grouping / clustering.
Also, there is a prototype of how this grouping can be used to make recommendations.
